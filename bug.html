<body>
  <div id="myDiv">
    This text will be hidden.
  </div>

  <script>
    // Incorrectly using innerHTML to set the div's content
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "<p>This text should be visible.</p>";

    // The bug is that the div's content will not appear as it's hidden by default
    // due to the CSS rule applied in an external stylesheet. This is not a typical error
    // and highlights the need to check all styles that affect an element's visibility.
