# Hidden Content Bug Despite innerHTML Modification

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug where content added using `innerHTML` does not appear because of conflicting CSS styles. The bug is subtle and highlights the importance of considering all CSS styles that might affect an element's visibility. 

## Bug Description
The `bug.html` file contains a `div` element with content that is initially hidden due to a default CSS rule. Attempting to update the div's content using `innerHTML` does not make the content visible.  The solution file resolves the problem.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the text within the div is not displayed, even though `innerHTML` is used to change it.

## Solution
The solution involves updating the CSS styles to make the div visible by default. This ensures that the `innerHTML` modification will successfully make the content visible.
